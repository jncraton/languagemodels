[{"name": "Mercury", "content": "Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth's, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites. \nAccording to current theories, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury has surface temperatures that change wildly during the day, ranging from 100 K (\u2212173 \u00b0C; \u2212280 \u00b0F) at night to 700 K (427 \u00b0C; 800 \u00b0F) during sunlight across the equator regions. At Mercury's poles though, there are large reservoirs of water ices that are never exposed to direct sunlight, which has an estimated mass of about 0.025\u20130.25% the Antarctic ice sheet. There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury's origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with planetesimal and rock vaporization. \nBecause Mercury is very close to the Sun, the intensity of sunlight on its surface is between 4.59 and 10.61 times the solar constant (amount of the Sun's energy received at 1 astronomical unit, which is roughly the distance between Earth and the Sun). Mercury orbits the Sun in a 3:2 spin\u2013orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the background stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. Counterintuitively, due to Mercury's slow rotation, an observer on the planet would see only one Mercurian solar day (176 Earth days) every two Mercurian solar years (88 Earth days each). Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1\u204430 of a degree), and its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System.Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit, making it appear in Earth's sky only as a \"morning star\" or \"evening star\" that's relatively close to the Sun. In English, it is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, communication and the messenger of gods. Mercury is the most difficult planet to reach from Earth because it requires the greatest change in spacecraft's velocity. Only two spacecraft have visited Mercury as of 2023: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975, and MESSENGER launched in 2004 and orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years. The BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025.\n\n"}, {"name": "Venus", "content": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a \"morning star\" or an \"evening star\". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears as such much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun, appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such prominent appearances in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.\nVenus retains, despite having only a weak induced magnetosphere, an especially thick atmosphere mainly of carbon dioxide, which, together with its global sulfuric acid cloud cover, creates an extreme greenhouse effect. These cause at the surface a mean temperature of 737 K (464 \u00b0C; 867 \u00b0F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a supercritical fluid, though at cloudy altitudes of 50 km (30 mi) Earthlike levels are found. Conditions possibly favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers, while recent research has found indicative, but not convincing, evidence. Early in Venus's history, water may have been abundant enough to form oceans, but any liquid water there will have evaporated when greenhouse effects cascaded and then been taken away into space by the solar wind. Internally Venus is thought to consist, like Earth, of a core, mantle, and crust, the latter releasing internal heat through its active volcanism, shaping the surface with large resurfacing instead of, as on Earth, plate tectonics.\nLike Mercury, Venus has no moons. Like Uranus's, its rotation is retrograde, against its orbital direction. Having been slowed by the strong currents and drag of the atmosphere, it completes a sidereal rotation, relative to the stars, in 243 Earth days. Therefore it rotates more slowly than it is orbiting the Sun, having a solar year of 224.7 Earth days, so that its solar day, or the time the Sun takes to cross the same meridian twice, is 117 Earth days long. Venus and Earth approach each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. While coming closer to each other at inferior conjunction than any other pair of the Sun's planets, since they have the closest two planetary orbits, they each still on average stay closer to Mercury than to any other planet, as Mercury passes by more frequently because of its more central, thus more rapid, orbit. That said, Venus and Earth have between them a lower difference in gravitational potential than exists between either of them and any other planet. This fact has allowed Venus to be the most accessible destination and attractive gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights.\nIn 1961, Venus became the target of the first interplanetary flight in human history, followed by many essential interplanetary firsts, confirming in 1970 Venus's inhospitable surface conditions with the first soft landing on another planet. This finding aborted any later representations of Venus as suitable for human habitation, once a popular theme in science fiction. Actual proposals, however, have suggested sending crews either on flybys, as gravity assists for crewed missions to Mars, or to enter the Venusian atmosphere and stay aloft, where, at sufficient altitude, conditions are more comparable to those on Earth's surface, including in respect of radiation and gravitation, than anywhere else in the Solar System. Currently, robotic probes are studying and more will be sent to study Venus, to provide crucial knowledge, particularly about greenhouse effects, and so inform predictions about global warming on Earth."}, {"name": "Earth", "content": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and found habitability. Earth is the only planet known to sustain liquid surface water, with ocean water extending over 70.8% of the planet, making it an ocean world. Most of all other water is retained in Earth's polar regions, with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water. The other 29.2% of the Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands, and is widely covered by vegetation. Below the planet's surface lies the crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside the Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.\nEarth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 \u00b0C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.\nEarth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. The Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces the Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth with the exception of Antarctica. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions."}, {"name": "Mars", "content": "Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname \"the Red Planet\".  Mars has a second smallest radius among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi) and has a surface gravity of 3.72 m/s2 (12.2 ft/s2), which is 38% of Earth's gravity. The Martian dichotomy can be clearly seen on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than Mars southern hemisphere. Mars has a very thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.\nGeologically, Mars is fairly active, with dust devils sweeping across the landscape and marsquakes (Martian analog to earthquakes) trembling underneath the ground. The surface of Mars hosts a shield volcano (Olympus Mons) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris). Mars's celestial motion is comparable to that of Earth, with a slightly eccentric orbit and an axial tilt only slightly greater than Earth's. This motion causes seasonal changes to the polar ice caps' coverage and temperature swings between \u2212110 \u00b0C (\u2212166 \u00b0F) to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) on the surface. A Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years.\nLike the other planets in the Solar System, Mars was formed 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period from 3.7 to 3.2\u20132 billion years ago was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues today, was marked by the wind's influence on geological processes. It is not yet known whether life has ever existed on Mars, though search for evidences of life on Mars is still ongoing.\nMars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and thus has been known from the ancient times.  The Romans named it for the god of war, M\u0101rs, as did Greeks (Ares) and Mesopotamians (Nergal), likely because its color suggested blood. Its high-contrast albedo features make it an attractive target for viewing with a telescope.\nSince the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with the first flyby by the Mariner 4 probe in 1965, the first Mars orbiter by the Mars 2 probe in 1971, and the first landing by the Viking 1 in 1976. As of 2023, there are at least 11 active probes orbiting Mars or at the Martian surface. Currently, Mars is an attractive target for the first future interplanetary human missions."}, {"name": "Jupiter", "content": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\nJupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.\nJupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the largest contiguous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.\nSince 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with two more either en route or awaiting launch."}, {"name": "Saturn", "content": "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).\nThe planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.\n\n"}, {"name": "Uranus", "content": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice giant. Most of Uranus is made out of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (\u2212224 \u00b0C; \u2212371 \u00b0F) out of all Solar System's planets. Uranus has a marked axial tilt of 97.8\u00b0 with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. \nUranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside Uranus's volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amount of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph), variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. Uranus also has a very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. \nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Uranus's ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light is reflected, and contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger 5 major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbit at much greater distance from Uranus are the known 9 irregular moons. Uranus magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may cause the darkening of its rings and moons.\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2023, Uranus was visited up close only one time when in 1986 the Voyager 2 probe flew by the planet. Though nowadays Uranus can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023\u20132032 survey."}, {"name": "Neptune", "content": "Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol , representing Neptune's trident.Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.\nLike the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of ices such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock; both planets are normally considered \"ice giants\" to distinguish them. Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance. Newest data from the Gemini observatory shows the blue colour is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to thinner haze of Neptune's more active atmosphere.In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. More recently, in 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied. In addition, these weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (\u2212218 \u00b0C; \u2212361 \u00b0F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 \u00b0C; 9,300 \u00b0F). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2."}]
